If credentials expire or change:

1. Home Assistant will automatically prompt for re-authentication
2. Enter the new **Username** and **Password**
3. Click **Submit**

The integration will reconnect without losing any device or entity configurations.

## Data Updates

The integration polls the Veeam Backup & Replication server every **60 seconds** to retrieve:
- Job status and statistics
- Repository information and capacity
- Server information and health status
- License details and expiration dates

**Update Behavior:**
- **New jobs/repositories**: Automatically detected and added as new devices
- **Status changes**: Reflected within the next polling cycle (60 seconds)
- **Failed connections**: Integration marks entities as unavailable and logs the error
- **Connection recovery**: Entities automatically become available when connection restored

## Entities

The integration creates devices for each monitored object (jobs, repositories, server, license), with multiple sensor entities per device:

### Job Devices

Each backup job creates a device with the following sensors:

- **Status Sensor**: `sensor.<job_name>_status`
  - State: Current job status (`success`, `running`, `failed`, `warning`, `unknown`)
- **Type Sensor**: `sensor.<job_name>_type`
  - State: Type of backup job
- **Last Run Sensor**: `sensor.<job_name>_last_run`
  - State: Timestamp of the last job execution
- **Next Run Sensor**: `sensor.<job_name>_next_run`
  - State: Timestamp of the next scheduled run

### Other Devices

The integration also creates devices for:
- **Repositories**: Each repository device has sensors for type, capacity, free space, used space, online status, etc., and a rescan button.
- **Scale-Out Backup Repositories (SOBRs)**: Each SOBR device has sensors for description, extent count, and buttons for each extent to enable/disable sealed mode and maintenance mode.
- **Server**: Server device has sensors for build version, platform, database info, etc.
- **License**: License device has sensors for status, edition, expiration dates, etc.

## Example Automations

### Notify on Backup Failure

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Notify on Veeam Backup Failure"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.my_backup_job_status
        to: "failed"
    action:
      - service: notify.notify
        data:
          title: "Veeam Backup Failed"
          message: "Backup job {{ trigger.to_state.name | replace(' Status', '') }} has failed!"
```

### Daily Backup Status Report

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Daily Veeam Status Report"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "08:00:00"
    action:
      - service: notify.notify
        data:
          title: "Veeam Backup Status"
          message: >
            {% set ns = namespace(jobs=[]) %}
            {% for sensor in states.sensor %}
              {% if sensor.entity_id.endswith('_status') and device_attr(sensor.entity_id, 'manufacturer') == 'Veeam' and device_attr(sensor.entity_id, 'model') == 'Backup Job' %}
                {% set ns.jobs = ns.jobs + [sensor.name | replace(' Status', '') ~ ': ' ~ sensor.state] %}
              {% endif %}
            {% endfor %}
            {{ ns.jobs | join('\n') if ns.jobs else 'No Veeam backup jobs found.' }}
```

## Removal

To remove the integration from Home Assistant:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find the **Veeam Backup & Replication** integration
3. Click the three dots menu (⋮) and select **Delete**
4. Confirm the deletion

All devices and entities associated with this integration will be removed.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: Integration fails to connect to Veeam server

**Solutions**:
- Verify the Veeam server is running and accessible from Home Assistant
- Check that the REST API is enabled on the Veeam server
- Confirm the hostname/IP and port (default: 9419) are correct
- Ensure firewall rules allow traffic on port 9419
- Try disabling SSL verification if using self-signed certificates

### Authentication Failures

**Problem**: Invalid credentials error during setup or re-authentication

**Solutions**:
- Verify the username and password are correct
- Ensure the account has administrator privileges on the Veeam server
- Check if account is locked or password has expired
- Try logging in to the Veeam console with the same credentials

### Missing Entities

**Problem**: Some jobs or repositories don't appear as entities

**Solutions**:
- Wait for the next polling cycle (60 seconds)
- Restart Home Assistant to force a full refresh
- Check the Home Assistant logs for API errors
- Verify the jobs/repositories exist in Veeam console

### Entities Unavailable

**Problem**: Entities show as "unavailable"

**Solutions**:
- Check network connectivity to the Veeam server
- Review Home Assistant logs for connection errors
- Verify the Veeam server and REST API are running
- Try re-authenticating the integration

### High API Load

**Problem**: Veeam server experiencing high API load

**Solutions**:
- The integration uses `PARALLEL_UPDATES = 1` to limit concurrent requests
- Polling interval is set to 60 seconds to balance freshness and load
- Consider adjusting via code if needed for very large deployments

## Known Limitations

- **Veeam Community Edition**: Not supported (lacks REST API)
- **API Version Compatibility**: Requires Veeam B&R 12.1 or newer
- **Stale Devices**: Deleted jobs/repositories remain as devices until manual removal (planned enhancement)
- **Large Deployments**: Polling 100+ jobs may take several seconds per cycle
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflected every 60 seconds, not immediately
- **SSL Certificates**: Self-signed certificates require SSL verification to be disabled

### Release Process

The version in `manifest.json` is automatically updated when a new release tag is created:

1. Create and push a tag with the format `v*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v0.3.1b3`)
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
   
   **Note:** Tags should be created from the default branch to ensure consistency.

2. The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
   - Extracts the version from the tag (removes the `v` prefix)
   - Updates the `version` field in `custom_components/veeam_br/manifest.json`
   - Commits and pushes the change to the default branch

3. The updated manifest.json is now ready for the release
